debug
.repro
foo.*
*.log     # Log files (duplicate removed, this is standard)
data      # IMPORTANT: Check if this refers to a directory '.config/nvim/data'
          # If so, and you want to ignore it, keep this line.

# --- LazyVim / lazy.nvim specific notes ---

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT ignore lazy-lock.json
# This file locks your plugin versions and should be committed!
# !lazy-lock.json

# The actual plugin code installed by lazy.nvim.
# By default, lazy.nvim installs plugins OUTSIDE your .config/nvim directory
# (e.g., ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/). You usually DON'T need to ignore it here.
# If you configured plugins to install *inside* .config/nvim, add that dir here.
# Example:
# lazy-plugins/

# --- Other common ignores ---
# OS-specific files (Optional)
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Personal notes or temporary files (Optional)
# *.local
# *.local.vim
# personal_notes.md
